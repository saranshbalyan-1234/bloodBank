    In a journey of more than 14 years from 14th Nov 2005 till today, F2S team
    has seen many ups and downs. Here are a few defining moments which have in a
    way recognised our efforts and strengthened our determination.<br /><br />

        ><br />It was dual celebration for LalIndia on 14th November 2019, one,
        it was F2S 14th anniversary and secondly, we crossed the benchmark of
        4,00,000 donors.<br /><br />It feels great for an organisation which
        started with 5 people to have reached 4,00,000 people today.<br /><br />
